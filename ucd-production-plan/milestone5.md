### [Milestone 5: Finalize Development and Trailer](milestone5.md)

This milestone is to wrap up content production and bug fixing. By this milestone your development of new features is long completed, and it should feel like you're tying up loose ends or polishing. Nothing new is being made.

Completion of this milestone is the beta or early access release version of your game. To an external playtester it feels done. You may have a few remaining things to finish, but players wouldn't likely know what those tasks are.
