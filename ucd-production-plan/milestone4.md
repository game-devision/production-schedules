### [Milestone 4: Iterative Development and Playtesting](milestone4.md)

This milestone is the core development time for your project. You are creating the game based off the feedback from the testing of your MVP and your concept of a vertical slice. You are building and incorporating assets. You are getting external playtesting periodically.

Completion of this milestone is the alpha version of your game. It should be gameplay feature complete, but the content may not be fully implemented and there are likely some (major) bugs. An external playtester should be able to play through and complete your game.

**Duration:** 4 sprints

**Week 1**
>   - Identify gameplay vertical slice, extrapolate from MVP
>   - Identify first jobs for each member

**Weekly**
>   - Communicate your next steps to your team
>   - Prioritize gameplay bugs
>   - Resolve any dependency blocks for your team
>   - Work on your next steps
>   - Incorporate your steps to the version

**When appropriate**
>   - Organize external playtests
>   - Polish completed and implemented features
