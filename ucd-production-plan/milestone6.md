### [Milestone 6: Publishing and Judging](milestone6.md)

This milestone is about hosting your finished game. Once hosted, games will be judged by peer review and the UCB council to determine which capstone project will be selected for the showcase.

Completion of this milestone means you know whether your game will be shown at Berkeley, and you and your team should be there too with a working copy on the laptop! Congratulations!
