### [Milestone 2: Design](milestone2.md)

**Duration:** 1 sprint

This milestone is to clearly articulate the core tenants of design for the game idea into something like a game design document.

Completion of this milestone means you have a game design document that everyone on the team has contributed to based on their role.

**Week 1**

>- Create a design around the original pitch concept:
>   * How does it play?
>   * What does it look like?
>   * Create the first draft of the design doc

**Week 2**
>- Refine the design:
>   * Incorporate/reject discussion feedback
>   * Imagine Minimum Viable Product (MVP)



### What is Design?
We say it like we know what it means. What does it mean to you?

> - The designer creates an Experience
> - The Game arises from the Experience
> - The Game begins with an Idea

### Who is the Designer?

Mantra:</br>
I am a game designer.

What is your job? You are a Creator. Create the experience you imagine.

> *And he who has to be a creator in good and evil, truly, has first to be a destroyer and break values. Thus the greatest evil belongs with the greatest good: this, however, is the creative good.* - Zarathustra

### What is an Experience?

Try the lens of Essential Experience. 

Figure out the essential elements that really define the experience you want to create, then find ways to make them part of your game design.

The key here is that the essential experience can often be delivered in a form that is very different from a real experience.

(Schell 22)

### What is a Game?

*A Game is something you play*

Who knows, but maybe play is a way to answer questions like:
* "What happens when i turn this knob?"
* "Can we beat this team?"
* "What can I make with this material?"
* "How many times can i jump this rope?"

*Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity*

(Schell 40)

Perhaps a better definition is a collection of properties:

* Games are entered willfully.
* Games have goals.
* Games have conflict.
* Games have rules.
* Games can be won and lost.
* Games are interactive.
* Games have challenge.
* Games can create their own internal value.
* Games engage players.
* Games are closed, formal systems.

Fundamentally,
*Games are problem-solving activities, approached with a playful attitude.*

(Schell 48)

### What is the idea?

**State the problem.**

> *Don't fall in love with your solution. Fall in love with your problem.* - anon

The purpose of design is to solve problems. Before coming up with ideas, be certain of why you are doing it. You may be designing for a problem space that is inaccurate if you do not state it.

**Where do ideas come from?**

> * We are so captivated by and entagled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions.*</br> - CG Jung

"God" is not a religious authority in this context: it is Your creative capability.

This is a philisophical question, but we believe ideas come from our subconscious. Nourish your subconscious, for if you ignore or discount it, it will speak less to you:
* Pay attention. Listen to your own "crazy ideas"
* Record your ideas. The human memory is terrible
* Feed it. An obsessive mind cannot be creative. Take care of business.
* Sleep.
* Don't push too hard. No amount of concentration or straining will speed things up.

**Brainstorm**
> *Creativity is for people who don't have a good idea in the first place.* -anon

* Write answers down to your stated problem. All of them.
* Write or type?
* Sketch
* Toys (play with the idea)
* Change your perspective (stand on your head!)
* Immerse yourself 
* Humor
* Spare no Expense (ballin with post-its)
* Writing on the Wall (literally)
* The space remembers (dedicate a region to the idea)
* Write everything (don't bring an umbrella to a brainstorm)
* Number your lists
* Destroy your Assumptions (e.g. "one game does not affect the next one")
* Mix and Match categories
* Talk to yourself
* Find a partner
(Schell 92)
