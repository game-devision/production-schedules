# 8-week Project Timeline
# The Berkeley way

## Milestones

The Berkeley method moves you out of each milestone with a playtest deliverable. At each milestone, your team will showcase your game and have your game be playtested. Each playtest will require a set of questions that you want playtesters to answer. One of your earliest tasks is to coordinate as a team and come up with a schedule to meet these deadlines.

* Milestone 0: [Game Design Doc](milestone0.md)
* Milestone 1: [MVP Playtest](milestone1.md)
* Milestone 2: [Alpha Playtest](milestone2.md)
* Milestone 3: [Beta Playtest](milestone3.md)
* Milestone 4: [Final Submission](milestone4.md)

âœ¨Showcase is Monday, December 9th ðŸŒ

## Suggested Sprints

### [Milestone 0: Game Design Doc](milestone0.md)

**To stay on schedule, you have 1 week to prepare this by 10/18**

I think everyone is tired of being told to make game design documents. However, think of the design doc as two things. First, it serves as your first "playtest" inside your own head. As you're imagining the game playout to write down your description of it, you have your first opportunity to think through what works or doesn't work. Second, it's a great way to easily share your initial ideas with people. Let them read your design doc before you start talking about it, and then the conversation could be more useful.

### [Milestone 1: MVP Playtest](milestone1.md)

**To stay on schedule, you have 2 weeks to prepare this by 10/25**

This is a playable prototype of your original pitch set forth in your game design document. At least two of the core mechancis in your game should be implemented, but no art is required.

Playtest feedback will inform whether game will be fun at a mechanical level, and to learn how it can be improved if it's not shaping up to be what you anticipated.

### [Milestone 2: Alpha Playtest](milestone2.md)

**To stay on schedule, you have 2 weeks to prepare this by 11/08**

The alpha build should contain all mechanics in place and in a testable space. Your general art style should be decided upon by now, and you should have a few key art assets included in the build. You should have a basic level. You will have bugs.

Playtest feedback should inform your full game loop. Do your players like the slice of gameplay you provided them?

### [Milestone 3: Beta Playtest](milestone3.md)

**To stay on schedule, you have 2 weeks to prepare this by 11/22**

The beta build should be mostly complete at this point. You should have completed a first pass on all art assets and they should be in the game. There can and will be bugs, but the game should be starting to look like a final project at this point. 

Playtest feedback should inform your difficulty tuning, the feel of interacting with all mechanics, and your overall art/audio aesthetic.

### [Milestone 4: Final Submission](milestone4.md)

**To stay on schedule, you have 2 weeks to complete this by 12/06**

Finished project! Your game should be complete and congruent with your original pitch. It should be playable from start to finish with art in place and all gameplay performing as intended. You shouldn't have any game-breaking bugs for sure, and maybe only a few edge-cases exist that haven't been caught in testing. You likely know all the glitches in the game and are working to patch those up before showcase.

Final checklist:

* Hosted online
* 9x9 graphic with the game's title for showcase big screen
* 30-60s trailer
* Game Poster for showcase table (sheet of paper)

Judging will begin when the project is flagged finished and winners will be declared after all submissions have been thoroughly playtested and vetted.

Winners will be announced prior to the 12/09 showcase date.
