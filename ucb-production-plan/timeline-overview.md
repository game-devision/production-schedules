# Game Development 8-week Project Timeline

A suggested approach and schedule to complete your team project within 8 weeks.

## Milestones

During the course of your project, you'll have to complete various milestones. These are the "industry standard" milestones. Adjust as necessary, knowing that your team will be ahead of schedule at some points and behind at others. Use this as guidelines for progress, not as assignment due dates.

* Milestone 0: [Explanation and Expectations](milestone0.md)
* Milestone 1: [Concept Pitch and Team Formation](milestone1.md)
* Milestone 2: [Design](milestone2.md)
* Milestone 3: [Prototype](milestone3.md)
* Milestone 4: [Iterative Development and Playtesting](milestone4.md)
* Milestone 5: [Finalize Development and Trailer](milestone5.md)
* Milestone 6: [Publishing and Judging](milestone6.md)

âœ¨Showcase is Monday, December 9th ðŸŒ

## Suggested Sprints

[**Day 0: Explanation and Expectation**](milestone0.md)

Day 0: Today we just talk about what it means to be participate in this capstone group project.

>- What does it all mean?
>- Commitment and accountability
>- Communication and checking in with your team
>- Prioritization of work


### [Milestone 1: Concept Pitch and Team Formation](milestone1.md)

**Duration:** 1 sprint

This milestone is about coming up with ideas for games, sharing them, discussing them, and deciding who goes on what team doing what job. 

Completion of the milestone means you have a pitch post in #game-ideas and a team organized of at least 2 people, but no more than 4.

**Week 1**
>- Create pitch posts in #game-ideas
>- Discuss posts in #game-ideas

**Week 2**
>- Form teams of 2-4 students based on preferred game idea and balanced roles in the team

### [Milestone 2: Design](milestone2.md)

**Duration:** 1 sprint

This milestone is to clearly articulate the core tenants of design for the game idea into something like a game design document.

Completion of this milestone means you have a game design document that everyone on the team has contributed to based on their role.

**Week 1**

>- Create a design around the original pitch concept:
>   * How does it play?
>   * What does it look like?
>   * Create the first draft of the design doc

**Week 2**
>- Refine the design:
>   * Incorporate/reject discussion feedback
>   * Imagine Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### [Milestone 3: Prototype](milestone3.md)

This milestone is about creating and testing only what is necessary to prove that your game idea is worth building to completion. The prototype is also the MVP.

Completion of this milestone is a prototype playtest. Someone should be able to play your game and understand the core concept of your original pitch.

**Duration:** 2 sprints

**Week 1**
>   - Identify what core mechanics comprise the MVP
>   - Identify what concept art is needed to communicate game aesthetic
>   - Establish version control system

**Week 2**
>   - Implement core mechanics for MVP
>   - Draft concept art

**Week 3**
>   - Implement/adjust core mechanics for MVP
>   - Implement concept art only where needed for MVP comprehension

**Week 4**
>   - Implement/adjust core mechanics for MVP
>   - Prototype playtest

### [Milestone 4: Iterative Development and Playtesting](milestone4.md)

This milestone is the core development time for your project. You are creating the game based off the feedback from the testing of your MVP and your concept of a vertical slice. You are building and incorporating assets. You are getting external playtesting periodically.

Completion of this milestone is the alpha version of your game. It should be gameplay feature complete, but the content may not be fully implemented and there are likely some (major) bugs. An external playtester should be able to play through and complete your game.

**Duration:** 4 sprints

**Week 1**
>   - Identify gameplay vertical slice, extrapolate from MVP
>   - Identify first jobs for each member

**Weekly**
>   - Communicate your next steps to your team
>   - Prioritize gameplay bugs
>   - Resolve any dependency blocks for your team
>   - Work on your next steps
>   - Incorporate your steps to the version

**When appropriate**
>   - Organize external playtests
>   - Polish completed and implemented features

### [Milestone 5: Finalize Development and Trailer](milestone5.md)

This milestone is to wrap up content production and bug fixing. By this milestone your development of new features is long completed, and it should feel like you're tying up loose ends or polishing. Nothing new is being made.

Completion of this milestone is the beta or early access release version of your game. To an external playtester it feels done. You may have a few remaining things to finish, but players wouldn't likely know what those tasks are.

**Duration:** 1 sprint

**Week 1**
>   - Complete all content
>   - Complete user interface, menus, etc.
>   - Complete any known bugs backlog
>   - Final external beta test
>   - Use editor and/or gameplay to capture footage for 90 second trailer

**Week 2**
>   - Repair anything identified during final beta test
>   - Work on / complete trailer

### [Milestone 6: Publishing and Judging](milestone6.md)

This milestone is about hosting your finished game. Once hosted, games will be judged by peer review and the UCB council to determine which capstone project will be selected for the showcase.

Completion of this milestone means you know whether your game will be shown at Berkeley, and you and your team should be there too with a working copy on the laptop! Congratulations!

**Duration:** ~1 sprint

**Week 1**
>   - Host on itch or somewhere similar
>   - Finalize gameplay trailer and other "marketing" materials for the published page
>   - Judging begins

**Week 2** 
>   - Judging concludes
>   - Selections announced
>   - UCB Showcase happens
